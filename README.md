# Coding my first website

Our task is to create a very simple website, with the tools that we already have. All we have to do is to open our computer, be it a laptop or a PC. Just power it on and open ***Notepad*** on Windows or ***TextEdit*** on Mac or ***Gedit*** on Linux.

Here is a quick preview of the structure of the website. It is not a design, it is not the final version, it’s just a simple drawing with the intention to show you a better picture of what we are required to do, where the elements sit on the web page and so on.

* The group of the two vertical columns should be as wide as the webpage is and as tall as the webpage is.
